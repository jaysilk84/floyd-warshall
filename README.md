# Floyd-Warshall
Implementation of the Floyd-Warshall algorthim to get the shortest distance between all vertices.
This code uses the distance matrix generated to find other graph distance metrics like radius,
diameter, eccentricity, and center.

## Why?
This started as a question when graphing a directed planer graph (with disconnected subgraphs) and
trying to find the midpoint when drawing on a canvas.
